Hi everyone! I’m a 3rd year Data Science major with a Math minor, and I’m so excited to meet and work with you all this quarter! I’m a San Diego native, and in my free time I like to dance, surf, skate, and read. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about data science or UCSD in general!
