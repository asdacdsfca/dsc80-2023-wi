Hello everyone - I'm Karthikeya. I am a senior year Data Science major. This is my second time tutoring DSC 80 and amongst all the classes I have tutored, DSC 80 is particularly exciting because of the range of topics covered. Outside data science, I love sports -- I play tennis and watch loads of cricket.
