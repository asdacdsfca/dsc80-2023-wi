Hey everyone! My name is Yash, and I’m a fourth-year majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science originally from the Bay Area. This is my 7th quarter as a Tutor, and I’m looking forward to meet you all! Feel free to drop by my Office Hours with any questions about classes, internships, or just to say hi! In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new restaurants, and following/playing sports (go Niners and Warriors)!
