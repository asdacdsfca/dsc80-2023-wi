Welcome to DSC 80! 👋 I’m in my second year as a lecturer in Data Science at UCSD, and this is my second time teaching DSC 80. Prior to moving to San Diego, I was a student at UC Berkeley, where I also taught Data Science. And before that, I grew up in Windsor, Ontario – make sure to tell me if you’re also Canadian! 🇨🇦 Outside of the classroom, you’ll find me trying new restaurants on Convoy 🍛, FaceTiming my dog 🐶 back home, or traveling ✈️ whenever I get a chance.

If there's anything you'd like to chat about outside of office hours, feel free to send me an email to set up a 1-on-1 meeting.
